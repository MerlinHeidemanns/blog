Today would have been the first full day of [C++Now 2020](https://cppnow.org)
in beautiful Aspen, Colorado... if not for coronavirus. I had had a good idea for a
lightning talk — okay, maybe not as good as ["Boost.Blockchain,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v2N12xeruc)
but — too good to lose. So I've recorded my lightning talk at home and uploaded it to YouTube!
You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO0p9zNCCDE).

To see me present the trick "live," join the Munich C++ Meetup's
[virtual meetup on May 7, 2020](https://www.meetup.com/MUCplusplus/events/269946215/),
at 7pm Munich time (1pm ET, 10am PT), where I'll also be presenting my
full-length C++Now submission, "The Complete Guide to `return x`."

If I hear of anyone else recording their C++Now 2020 lightning talks, I'll link to them here.
